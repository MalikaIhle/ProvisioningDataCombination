# Behavioural compatibility in Provisioning : DATA ANALYSES

## Alternation

### Replication Bebbington & Hatchwell .R

source compilation_provisioning to get the data

simulation of random alternation for given provisioning rates






# Compilation provisioning .R : DATA EXTRACTION



## extract raw data in excel files and Database and give list of errors in the original excel files

give 'Tstart' 'Tend' 'Sex' for all excel files

for old files, also gives comments 'S', 'IN', 'O' with color of 'O' visits

query the DB to get MY_tblParentalCare, MY_tblBrood, MY_tblDVDInfo

creates all R_output 




# ErrorChecking


## ProvisioningErrorCheck: to standardize file, correct chronology, fill in missing info

### for files with Old Template

I am assuming that 
'O' blue means feeding from the outside
'O' grey means hanging out of the nest box
'S' is hanging out at the nest box before entering it or after leaving it
and therefore I changed files accordingly (specifically files for 2010-2011 with old template)

we corrected all illogical chronology with the videos unless specified (i.e. for a few missing DVDs, I just indicated a logical time that had the least impact on the original data)

we removed all comments other than 'O' 'G' 'S' 'IN' to the next empty column or the 'activity' column
and replaced it appropriately (i.e. following the definitions above)

we standardized  all time when bird was 'IN' at begining (Tin = 0) and at the end (Tout = tape length)

the data is contained in the second sheet (create sheet1 otherwise)

#### importantly: we corrected the raw data of each excel files but not their summary. This will be directly corrected in the DB when Ian Stevensson import the R_output with the raw data, and when he creates a sys_query recreating this summary



### for files with New Template

Checked that all Tout were filled in, chronology logical, no comments within the raw data






## LogChangesExcelFiles

all changes made to the original excel files from the dropbox according to the rules above, the queries in ProvisioningErroCheck, and the code in compilation_provisioning, were logged in here.

the original copies were backedup on the HS google drive

all original xls files were converted to xlsx





## R_Compare_DB_and_R_output

### R_Compare_tblParentalCare

this compare tblParentalCare from the database (which included typos and other mistakes), and the same table generated by my code combination_provisionning.R > my code is correct in all cases checked.


### R_Compare_NbChicksDuringRecording

this compare the number of chicks calculated to be alive at time of recording, the number of chicks during a visit on the same day as the recording, and the number of chicks given in tblDVDInfo > nothing is matching, but:
- tblDVDInfo number of chicks is correct for 2004 2005 (Shinichi checked the nest), but death dates are not (indicated as being on the last day seen alive, instead of the day found to be missing)
- tblDVDInfo number of chicks is estimated in subsequent years (from previous nest check) but about correct...





# R_input

## .txt

a few temporary txt files, resulting of temporary queries of the DB.
ultimately, everything will be called directly from the DB with the code compilation_provisioning.R



# R_output


### R_RawFeedingVisits

thi is all the raw data with only feeding visits (OF, IN or INorOF), where a succession OF-IN has been merged into one visit (run 20160324)


### R_RawAllVisits_forDB

this as all the raw data until time of code run (last: 20160323)
this is the raw data I will do my analyses on, this is also what Ian Stevensson could import into the DB
(historically, it first included files from 2004 to 2014, then 206 missing files from this period, then videos from 2015 from Andrew)


## R_MY_tables 

data, meta data, and summary of data I calculated


### R_MY_DVDInfo

only for analysed video


### R_MY_tblBroods

all broods where at least one social parent identified, even those not video taped


### R_MY_RawFeedingVisits

OF directly followed by IN are merged feeding visits
Interval calculated


### R_MY_tblParentalCare

summary stats for all analyzed videos
